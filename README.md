QUIZ APPLICATION

Introduction Layer:
When the webpage loads, the user is greeted with a welcoming message and a "Start Quiz" button.

Info Layer:
Upon clicking the "Start Quiz" button, an information layer smoothly slides in from the top.
This layer contains a brief introduction to the quiz and presents two options: "Exit" and "Continue."

Quiz Layer:
If the user clicks "Continue," the information layer disappears, and the Quiz Layer appears with an animated transition.
The Quiz Layer consists of a header with the quiz title and a countdown timer on the right side.
A progress bar is displayed below the header, indicating the remaining time.
Multiple-choice questions with options are presented in the center.
As the timer counts down from 15 to 0 seconds, the progress bar moves accordingly.

User Interaction:
Users can select an answer by clicking on an option within the 15-second time frame.
If the user selects the correct answer within the time limit, the selected option turns green, and a checkmark icon appears, indicating correctness.
If the user selects the wrong answer, the selected option turns red, a cross icon appears, and the correct answer is highlighted.
If the timer reaches 0 seconds and the user hasn't selected an answer, the timer stops, and the correct answer is automatically highlighted.

Navigation:
After each question, a "Next" button becomes available to proceed to the next question.
A total of five questions are presented in this manner.

Result Layer:
Once all questions are answered or the user clicks the "Next" button after the final question, the Result Layer slides into view.
The Result Layer displays the user's score, indicating how many questions were answered correctly out of five.
Two options are provided: "Replay Quiz" and "Quit Quiz."

Restart or Quit:
If the user selects "Replay Quiz," the quiz restarts with the first question, and the user's score resets to 0.
If the user selects "Quit Quiz," the webpage is reloaded, and the quiz begins from the beginning.
This alternative description maintains the same core functionality but offers a slightly different way to present the flow and interactions of the quiz app. You can implement this structure using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as mentioned earlier in the first response.
